# Intro to Electrical Engineering

## Setup

- Each station has:
  - Power supply
  - Digital Multimeter
    - Sometimes parting gift for cadets
  - Plugboard
  - 4 wires
    - 4 max, usually already in the desk drawer
  - 2 resistors 
    - usually already in the desk drawer
    - (doesn't matter which ones or if they're consistent across the room)
- Tech will set up lab for soldering workshop
- Have the box of solder kits in the room
  - Use electronic bagpipes kit
  - Have each cadet take one on the way out
- Have box of 9V batteries available

## Outline

(1 hour for classroom stuff)

- Welcome to EE!
  - What we do
- About me!
  - Ask me questions if you want!
- Around the room
  - Name / hometown
- Ohm's Law
  - Describe variables
  - Water analogy
- How to draw a circuit
  - Simple picture with DC source and single resistor
  - What do resistors model?  Any sort of device we want to power (light, TV, computer, etc.)
- Build the circuit!
  - Make the voltage supplied 5V 
- Describe DMM
  - Use DMM to measure voltage across resistor
  - Same as what comes from the source!
- Simple parallel circuit
  - Build it!
  - What's the voltage across each? Same!
- Describe KVL and Loops
- Simple series circuit
  - Build it!
  - What's the voltage across each?  Different!
    - Bigger resistor drops more voltage
- How is your house wired?
  - Parallel!  Because anytime you plug something in it gets the same voltage!
  - Show circuit of multiple items
  - Who has ever blown a fuse or circuit breaker?
    - Show what happens with a short!
- Tour of Department
  - UAS Lab
  - Power Lab
  - Anechoic Chamber
