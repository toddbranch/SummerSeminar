# Summer Seminar

## Welcome

Welcome to Intro to Electrical Engineering

How many of you took Intro to Digital Design with me yesterday?  What'd you think?

Everyone else:
How's Summer Seminar so far?  Getting a feel for what life is like as a cadet?  Still want to come here?  My job today is to give you a little taste of academics at USAFA and what we do in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

Set the tone: Relax.  I'm not assessing you.  My goal is that you have fun, learn some cool stuff, and leave her excited to learn more about Computer Engineering.  
On that note: YouTube videos with electrical engineer that hurts himself.

## Intros

- Instructor Introduction
- Student Introductions
    - Name, hometown, school

Why'd you sign up for this class?  Why engineering?  Why digital?  Allow for volunteers.

Why I think this stuff is cool.  
My interest lays more on the computer engineering / computer science things side of things.  But EE is the foundation of it all.  It's very important to have a strong foundation in the low-level stuff in order to understand the higher level stuff. In fact, some colleges still have EECS departments (MIT).  It's also practical.  In order to build cool things with embedded devices, you need to know how analog electronics work.  Need to know how to power your devices without frying them, etc.

We're not going to take the entire time - only 3 hours.  And I'll do my best to keep it interesting / engaging.

## What's an engineer?

## General Background Knowledge
Circuit Variables
- Introduce Ohm's Law
    - V = IR
    - Circuit Variables (use water analogy)
        - Voltage
        - Current
        - Resistance

Most simple devices can be modeled as a resistor.  What happens when you pass too much current through a given resistor.  You release the magic smoke!  That's a BAD THING.  How can we protect against this?
Talk about fuses with respect to current.  What's the purpose of a fuse?  [DEMO]

Talk about drawing circuits.  And how to hook them up on a breadboard.  Have them create a simple circuit and measure circuit variables.  Voltage, Current, Resistance.  Talk about how to measure using the DMM.

Measure resistance of a given device (motor or lightbulb).

Introduce parallel and series resistance.  Have them setup some resistors in parallel and series and measure outcomes.  What happens?  Introduce equations.

Let's talk about some other circuit rules:
- KVL
    - The some of the voltages in a loop is 0.  Or voltage rise equals voltage drop in a loop.
    - What's a loop?
    - Identify loops on the board.
    - Validate with simple circuit, DMM.

- KCL
    - The sum of the currents at a node is 0.  Or current entering equals current leaving a ndoe.
    - What's a node.
    - Identify nodes on the board.
    - Validate with simple circuit, DMM.

- AC vs DC
