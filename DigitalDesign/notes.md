# Summer Seminar

## Welcome

Welcome to Intro to Digital Design.

How's Summer Seminar so far?  Getting a feel for what life is like as a cadet?  Still want to come here?  My job today is to give you a little taste of academics at USAFA and what we do in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

Set the tone: Relax.  I'm not assessing you.  My goal is that you have fun, learn some cool stuff, and leave her excited to learn more about Computer Engineering.  
On that note: YouTube videos with electrical engineer that hurts himself.

## Intros

- Instructor Introduction
- Student Introductions
    - Name, hometown, school

Why'd you sign up for this class?  Why engineering?  Why digital?  Allow for volunteers.

Why I think this stuff is cool.

We're not going to take the entire time - only 3 hours.  And I'll do my best to keep it interesting / engaging.

Block structure:  
- General Background Knowledge
- Digital Design
- Intro to Microcontrollers and Embedded Programming
- Soldering

## Digital Design

[Hands-on Portion]

That's cool, but so what?!  What really useful things can we make out of this?  
Say we wanted to add binary numbers together.  [Draw, walk through operation of half-adder, full-adder]

By combining these basic elements into useful components, we can begin to do more interesting things.  [Show EE hierarchy image]

But still, so what?!  I want to make web servers or smartphones or quadrotors.  How do we make the real stuff?

**CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE**
Ask whether they want to keep going hands-on with 555 timer or learn about microcontrollers and watch me do some programming.

## Intro to Microcontrollers and Embedded Programming



Show some of the projects cadets made in ECE383 last semester.

## Soldering
